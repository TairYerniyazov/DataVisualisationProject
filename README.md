# Data Visualisation Project: EU Data Analysis 🇪🇺 

This repository contains the code and data for a data visualization project on EU data analysis. The project involves creating visualisations of a variety of EU datasets, including:

* adjusted salary;
* CO2 emissions;
* life expectancy;
* unemployment rates;
* infographics.

> The code for the visualisations is written in Python using the Jupyter Notebook (tested in Google Colab). Each of the folders mentioned above (except the one dedicated to infographics) contains a Colab notebook.

**💰 Adjusted salary:** the notebook visualises the average salary in each EU member state. This allows us to compare salaries across different countries.

**♻️ CO2 emissions:** the notebook visualises the total CO2 emissions of the EU members state since 1792. This allows us to track the progress of EU countries in reducing their emissions and to compare them across different countries. You can see the changes on the generated maps.

**🧓🏻 Life expectancy:** the notebook visualises the average life expectancy in each EU member state. You can easily compare it as we prepared some maps for it as well.

**💼 Unemployment rates:** the notebook visualises the unemployment rate in each EU member state. This allows us to track changes in the unemployment rate and to compare it across different countries.

**🖼️ Infographics:** the folder contains 3 small infographics used in the other notebooks.

**Summary:** the `EU_Data_Analysis.ipynb` notebook contains a summary of the project and links to the Colab notebooks for each of the visualisations.
