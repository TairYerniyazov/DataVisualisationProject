# Data Visualization Project: EU Data Analysis 🇪🇺 

This repository contains the code and data for a data visualization project on EU data analysis. The project involves creating visualisations of a variety of EU datasets, including:

* adjusted salary;
* CO2 emissions;
* life expectancy;
* unemployment rates;
* infographics.

> The code for the visualisations is written in Python using the Jupyter Notebook (tested in Google Colab). Each of the folders mentioned above (except "infographics/") contains a Colab notebook.

**💰 Adjusted salary:** The adjusted salary notebook visualizes the average salary in each EU member state. This allows users to compare salaries across different countries.

**♻️ CO2 emissions:** The CO2 emissions notebook visualises the total CO2 emissions of the EU members state since 1792. This allows users to track the progress of EU countries in reducing their emissions and to compare emissions across different countries. You can track the changes on the generated maps.

**🧓🏻 Life expectancy:** The life expectancy notebook visualises the average life expectancy in each EU member state. You can easily compare it as we prepared some maps here as well.

**💼 Unemployment rates:** The unemployment rates notebook visualises the unemployment rate in each EU member state. This allows users to track changes in the unemployment rate and to compare it across different countries.

**🖼️ Infographics:** The infographics folder contains three small infographics used in particular notebooks.

**Summary:** The `EU_Data_Analysis.ipynb` notebook contains a summary of the project and links to the Colab notebooks for each of the visualisations.
